# Order Validation Script

This simple Python script is designed to validate customer orders by checking:

- The number of products (must be between 1 and 50)
- The order price (must be greater than 0)
- The payment status (`placeno`, `neplaceno`, `na cekanju`)

The script provides appropriate messages based on the inputs and determines whether the order can be processed.
